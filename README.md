##Why is this project meaningful to my career?


Network calls to web servers and third-party API's are a large part of today's mobile app world. The main purpose of Weather Cast was to create a stylish iOS app that leveraged the many network operations used by some of the most popular mobile applications. On top of all this, parsing web data and storing that information into custom data structures was required to follow proper MVC design patterns.
